# Supervised-Machine-Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

## Background
In this assignment a machine learning model was built to attempt to predict whether a loan would be approved or not.
A comparison was made between the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier. 

## Steps
* Used Pandas to import the data (lending_data.csv) located in the Resources folder
* Made a prediction as to which model would perform better
* Created a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the data, and printed the model's score
* Created a Random Forest Classifier model, fit it to the data, and printed the model's score
* Wrote results and compared results to prediction
